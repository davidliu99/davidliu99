Hi, I'm David! I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in mathematics. I enjoy coding and working with data; I've recently been working on an interactive [visualization](https://davidliu99.github.io/il_elections) of statewide election results in my home state of Illinois. Go check it out! Previously, I worked on [Metrole](https://davidliu99.github.io/metrole), a geographical guessing game based on American cities.
