Hi, I'm David! I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in mathematics and minored in computer science. I currently work as a software engineer at Amazon. Prior to joining Amazon, I worked on an interactive [visualization](https://davidliu99.github.io/il_elections) of statewide election results in my home state of Illinois. I also created [Metrole](https://davidliu99.github.io/metrole), a geographical spin-off of Wordle based on American cities.
