Hi, I'm David! I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in mathematics. I enjoy coding and working with data; I've recently been working on [Metrole](https://davidliu99.github.io/metrole), a geographical guessing game inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/). Go check it out!
